    <h4> Hello Friends. Let Us Explore My Console App </h4>
    <h4> My Console App Is On Sara Ali Khan </h4>
    <p> Khan's debut came in 2018 with Abhishek Kapoor's romantic disaster film Kedarnath, in which she played a Hindu girl who falls in love with a Muslim porter, played by Sushant Singh Rajput.[25] In preparation for her role, Khan improved her knowledge of Hindi vocabulary with help from Rajput.[26] A dispute between Kapoor and KriArj Entertainment, the producers, led to a temporary suspension in filming, until RSVP Movies took over production duties from the latter company.[27][25] A few weeks before release, priests of Kedarnath Temple demanded the film's boycott as they believed it promoted Love Jihad, and a Bharatiya Janata Party leader also urged for a ban.[28][29] As a result, the film was banned in the state of Uttarakhand.[30] Kedarnath received mixed reviews with praise directed to Khan's performance.[31] Kunal Guha of Mumbai Mirror found it to be a rehash of 1980s Hindi films but appreciated Khan's act: "When her Mukku is angry, hopeful, desperate or coltish, she often conveys it through her eyes alone — giving us a taste of the diverse faces she can throw on."[32] Meena Iyer of Daily News and Analysis similarly labelled her "spectacular".[33] Kedarnath emerged as a commercial success.[34][35] Khan was awarded with the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut and the IIFA Award for Star Debut of the Year – Female.[36][37]

        A few weeks after the release of Kedarnath, Khan starred in Rohit Shetty's action film Simmba, alongside Ranveer Singh, which was loosely based on the Telugu-language film Temper (2015).[38] She began work on it when filming of Kedarnath was temporarily suspended.[39][40] This led to Abhishek Kapoor suing Khan; they later settled out of court when she agreed to split her time between both films.[41][42] Reviewing the film for The Times of India, Ronak Kotecha opined that Khan had "precious little to do besides looking breathtakingly beautiful" and disliked the chemistry between her and Singh.[43] With worldwide earnings of ₹4 billion (US$53 million), Simmba emerged as the third highest-grossing Hindi film of 2018.[44]
        
        In Imtiaz Ali's romantic drama Love Aaj Kal (2020), a spiritual successor to Ali's 2009 film of the same name, Khan starred as a young woman with a troubled past, opposite Kartik Aaryan.[45][46] In a negative review of the film, Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in bemoaned that Khan "simply doesn’t have the experience or the expertise" to play a complex character, adding that "having a camera shoved into her young face only enlarges her shortcomings".[47] It emerged as a box office bomb.[48]
        
        Khan starred opposite Varun Dhawan in the comedy film Coolie No. 1, an adaptation of David Dhawan's 1995 film of the same name. </p>
